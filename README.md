# Movies-ETL.
* ETL Process

In this module I created an ETL pipeline from very raw data in a SQL database, exctracting data using Python, cleanning this information using Pandas this was a lot of work actually. I did use regular expressions to parse and load with PostgreSQL verified by PgAdmin.

# Summary 

A new databased was created with to main columns "Movies" and "Ratings". This new database is going to be used by the analyst on the hackathon.

# Resources 

* Data Source: wikipedia-movies.json, movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv
* Software: Python3.8, Jupyter notebook 6, PostgreSQL 11.9, pgAdmin 4
